				<section>
					<h3>What is Epidemiology?</h3>
					<blockquote>the study of how disease is distributed in populations and the factors that influence or determine this distribution - Gordis Epidemiology</blockquote>
					<p>or..</p>

					<section>
						<h3>Objectives of Epdidemiology</h3>
						

						<ol>
							<li>identify disease etiology (cause) and risk factors</li>
							<li>determine extent of disease</li>
							<li>study the disease's natural history and prognosis</li>
							<li>evaluate existing and new preventative and therapeutic measures and health care delivery</li>
							<li>develop public policy</li>

						</ol>
					

					</section>



						
					<section>
						

						<li>1) identify disease etiology (cause) and risk factors (factors increasing a person's risk of disease)
						- how transmitted, why arises from risk behaviours?
						- aim: intervene to reduce morbidity and mortality -> develop prevention programs by identifying and reduce/eliminate exposure to causal factors, develope vaccines and treatments to prevent transmission </li>
						<li>2) determine extent of disease
						- what is the burden of disease in the community?
						aim: plan health services/facilities, estimate how future health care providers should be trained</li>
					</section>
					
					<section>
						
						
							<li>3) study the disease's natural history and prognosis 
					- severity, duration of survival
					aim - quantitatively define baseline natural history of disease, compare baseline data with results from using newly developled intervention to test if new approaches are effective </li>
					<li>4) evaluate existing and new preventative and therapeutic measures and health care delivery
					- does cancer screening test improve survival of cancer patients? has growth of health care system impacted patients' health outcomes or quality of life?
					aim: if yes, what is nature, how measured?</li>
					<li>5) developing public policy
					environmental, genetic, social, behaviroal considerations of disease prevention and health promotion
					- is radiation from kitchen microwaves a health hazard, what regulations required to reduce risks? </li>
				</ol>

					</section>

				<section>Changing Patterns
					Epidemiology provides clues to changes in health problems in communities over time
					[signs show the importance of cholera in public conciousness
					<img src="cholera"> ]
					Diseases affecting US - changed from 1900
					Developing countries different to devleoped/industrialised. new diseases though

					US life expectancy from 1900,1950,2014 at birth and age 65, split between ethnicity. see expectancy incrased at birth, due to less child mortlity, but not much changed in older age, suggest more needs to be done

				</section>


				
				<section>Epidemiology and Prevention
					Epidemiological evidence used to:
					<ol>identify high-risk subgroups</ol>
					<ol>identify high-risk factors: age, sex, ethnicity non-modifyiable. Obesity, smoking, diet, sexual practices, lifestyle factors modifyible - opp to dev and introduce preventation to change exposures/risk factors </ol>

				<section>Epidemiology and Clinical Practice
					clinical practice population-based

				</section>
				
				<section>Epidemiologic Approach
					How does an epidemiologist identify disease cause?
					1) determine if association exists between exposure to a factor/characteristic and presence of disease
					- study group and indivudals characteristics
					2) identify from associations if there is a possible causal relationship (not all associations are causal)

					investigate from data --> ask questions

					example: fluroride on dental caries

					demonstrate causal relationship further
					example: removing fluoride on dental caries

						<h2>Ignaz Semmelweis and Childbed Fever</h2>

						<img class="plain" data-src="img/gordisepi.jpg" alt="Semmelweis">

						First Obstetrical Clinic of the General Hospital in Vienna, July 1846.

						Two clinics, First and Second, pregnant women admitted for childbirth to either one on an alternating 24-hr bases.

						First clinic staffed by physcians and med students, who performed autopsies in the morning on women who'd died from childbed fever. Second clinic staffed by midwives, who didn't perform autopsies.


					</section>
					

					<section>
						
						Mortatility in First Clinic more than twice as much in the Second Clinic. 16% v 7%

						Semmelweis observed that mortality was higher because physicans / sutdents in the First Clinic went directly from autoposises to patients, to do manual examinations involving 'traumatizing tissues of the vagina and uterus' 

						Semmelweis suggested that physican and med student hands were transmitting disease-causing particles from cadavers to women about to deliver.

						Suspicions confirmed when friend and colleague Jakob Kolletschka died from infection from accidental puncture of student's knife during an autopsy. Kolletschka's autospy similar pathology to childbed fever women.

					</section>
					
					<section>
						
						Semmelweis then developed a policy: First Clinic staff required to wash hands and brush under fingernails after autopsies and before seeing patients.

						In 1848, mortality in the First Clinic dropped from 12.2% to 2.4%, similar to rate in the Second Clinic that year.

						Semmelweis was later replaced by a physican who removed the handwashing policy, First Clinic mortality rates rose - further evidence supporting causal relationship.

					<h2>When Disease Frequency Declines, Who Deserves the Credit?</h2>

					Mortality rates from common infectious diseases decreased in the US in the last 100 years, e.g. TB, scarlet fever, whooping cough.

					Tempting to link declines to improved treatemtns or vaccines made available in this time. 

					</section>

					
					<section>
						
						However, Edward Kass' graphs published in 1971 show major decline in mortality occurred years before effective treatment/vaccine available. 

						How to explain the decline before treatment available? Theoretically - human exposure to organisms involved may have declined, or virulence of organism diminished.

						Primarily - result from improvements in social conditions, safer waters, reduced exposures to pollutants, improved nutrition and santitation - unrelated to medical intervention. 

					</section>

					<section>
						Lesson - cautious before attributing medical intervention to declined mortality over time. This is why epidemiologic studies are essential to assess medical intervention effictivess, difficult to infer soley from population-wide mortality.

					<h2>Integrating Prevention and Treatment</h2>

					Often seen as mutually exclusive, but preventation is integral to public health and clinical practice.

					Treatment of disease includes prevention.

					When treating illness, we're preventing death, complications, impact on people. Therapy involves secondary and tertiary prevention mostly, e.g. disability

					Drugs used for patients with clear diagnoses of the disease are now being evaluated for use as drugs that can prevent the disease in high-risk patients

					studies: HIV and Alzheimer disease.


				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Conclusion</h2>
					Epidemiology is a tool that provides a rational basis for planning and implementing effective prevention

					clinical investigations: evaluate new and used therapies and new interventions for disease prevention

					ultimate goal: use prevention and treatment to improve control of disease, which will prevent deaths amd improve quality of life
